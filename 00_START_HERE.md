## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start (2 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
./setup.sh

# 2. Start the server (in SBCL)
sbcl
> (ql:quickload :mud)
> (mud:start)

# 3. Connect players (in another terminal)
telnet localhost 8888
```

### Testing the System

```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
./test-setup.sh

# Or run system verification
sbcl --script test-system.lisp
```

### Example Session

```
$ telnet localhost 8888
Connected to localhost.
Welcome to the MUD!

=== The Tavern ===

You see:

Exits: north

> look

=== The Tavern ===

You see:

Exits: north

> go north
You go north.

=== A Dense Forest ===

You see:

Exits: south

> say Hello!
You say: Hello!

> quit
Goodbye!
Connection closed.

## 🛠️ Extension Guide

### Adding a New Command (Easy)

```lisp
(define-command "drop" (player args)
  ;; Your command implementation here
  )
```

See DEVELOPMENT.md for complete examples.

### Creating New Object Types (Moderate)

```lisp
(defclass mud-weapon (mud-object)
  ((damage :initarg :damage
           :accessor weapon-damage
           :initform 5)))
```

### Building World Content (Easy)

Use `create-room`, `room-add-exit`, `world-add-room` to build your world.

### Key Entry Points

- **Start server**: `(mud:start)` or `(mud:start :port 8888)`
- **Stop server**: `(mud:stop)`
- **Check status**: `(mud:status)`
- **Create room**: `(mud:create-room :name "Room Name")`
- **Create player**: `(mud:create-player "Name" socket)`

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Object Model
```
mud-object (base)
  ├─ Properties (extensible hash table)
  ├─ ID (unique, auto-generated)
  ├─ Name (display name)
  ├─ Type (classification)
  └─ Location (where it is)

mud-room (extends mud-object)
  ├─ Contents (array of objects)
  └─ Exits (hash map of directions)

mud-player (extends mud-object)
  ├─ Socket (network connection)
  └─ Inventory (array of objects)
```

### Threading Model
- **Main thread**: Server core
- **Accept thread**: Connection handling
- **Per-player threads**: Individual player loops
- **Thread-safe**: Locks protect shared state

### Command Processing Flow
```
Input → Parse → Lookup → Execute → Send Response
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Cannot find system :mud" | Ensure mud.asd is in current directory |
| "Address already in use" | Change port in src/constants.lisp |
| "Cannot load component usocket" | Run `(ql:quickload (list "usocket" "bordeaux-threads"))` |
| Cannot connect with telnet | Verify server started (check SBCL output) |
| Command doesn't work | Check command name, use `help` to list available |

## ✨ Key Features Differentiating This MUD

1. **Living Image** - Foundation for persistent Lisp-like environment
2. **In-World Programming** - Architecture ready for live code modification
3. **Extensible Objects** - Hash-based properties allow runtime modification
4. **Clean Architecture** - Well-organized modules, easy to understand and modify
5. **Multi-threaded** - Proper concurrent player handling
6. **Command Macro System** - Super easy to add new commands

---

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

This project follows DGD and LMUD principles:

1. **Everything is an object** - Consistent object model
2. **Properties over slots** - Runtime extensibility
3. **Live environment** - Server doesn't need restart to change code
4. **Lisp-native** - Leverage Common Lisp's power
5. **Modular design** - Each component has clear responsibility
6. **Extensible** - Easy to add new features without modifying core
