;;;; src/worlds/world-areas.lisp — Pre-built transient world areas
;;;;
;;;; These builder functions create the transient room/NPC layout for the
;;;; Apeiron world: the hub biomes, Desert Oasis Mall, and the Team Rocket
;;;; cavern maze.  Call INITIAL-WORLD to produce a mud-world that can then
;;;; be materialized into a persistent-world via APEIRON.PERSISTENCE:MATERIALIZE-WORLD.
