;;;; telnet/connection.lisp — Telnet connection handler using flexi-streams
;;;;
;;;; Provides a maximally portable telnet connection that:
;;;;   1. Extracts the native socket FD from the usocket wrapper
;;;;   2. Creates a binary stream for byte-level I/O
;;;;   3. Implements RFC 854 telnet protocol processing (IAC escaping,
;;;;      option negotiation, subnegotiation)
;;;;   4. Uses flexi-streams for UTF-8 ↔ bytes encoding
;;;;
;;;; Architecture:
;;;;   Application (character I/O)
;;;;        ↑ ↓
;;;;   flexi-streams (string-to-octets / octets-to-string)
;;;;        ↑ ↓
;;;;   Telnet IAC processor (escape/unescape, command handling)
;;;;        ↑ ↓
;;;;   Binary stream (from socket FD)
;;;;
;;;; The binary stream is created directly from the socket FD so we
;;;; have full control over byte-level I/O.  The usocket's character
;;;; stream is never used — we keep the usocket only for wait-for-input
;;;; and socket-close.  This avoids the SBCL-internals hack in the old
;;;; session-keepalive (which wrote raw bytes through sb-unix:unix-write).

TIMEOUT is the total maximum time to wait in seconds.
POLL-INTERVAL is the granularity of polling in seconds.
ECHO controls server-echo mode (default T).  When T the server echoes
printable characters back to the client and sends BS SP BS (08 20 08)
sequences for erase operations.  Set to NIL for silent input (e.g.
password prompts).

Returns (values line nil) on success, where LINE is a string
without the trailing newline.
Returns (values nil :timeout) on timeout.
Returns (values nil :eof) when the connection is closed.
Returns (values nil :connection-lost) on error.

NOTE: This function accumulates characters in a LOCAL buffer.  It must
NOT reuse the connection's LINE-BUFFER slot, because TELNET-READ-CHAR
