# QUICK REFERENCE CARD

## 🚀 Start the Server (2 minutes)

```bash
# Step 1: Install dependencies (first time only)
./setup.sh

# Step 2: Start the server
sbcl
> (ql:quickload :mud)
> (mud:start)
```

## 🎮 Play the MUD

```bash
# In another terminal, connect as a player
telnet localhost 8888

# Commands while playing:
look              # See current room
go north          # Move north (or south, east, west)
exits             # See available exits
inventory         # See what you're carrying
say hello!        # Say something to other players
help              # List all commands
quit              # Disconnect
```

## 🛑 Stop the Server

```lisp
# In the SBCL window where you started it:
> (mud:stop)
```

## 📊 Check Server Status

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Cannot find :mud" | Make sure mud.asd is in current dir |
